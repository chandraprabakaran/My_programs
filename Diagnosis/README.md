## Project Description
This model is developed to measure the accuracy of patients in diagonsing
### Comaprision:
The three algorithms are compared such as Naive Bayes classifier,Decision Tree and Random forest to measure which algorithm is acheiving highest accuracy with low error rate.

### Dataset:
Diagnosis.csv file is used and the column names are 'Temperature of patient', 'Occurrence of nausea', 'Lumbar pain', 'Urine pushing', 'Micturition pains',
       'Burning of urethra', 'decision: Inflammation of urinary bladder',
       'decision: Nephritis of renal pelvis origin'.
       
### Results :
The results are compared with exisiting algorithms
