Too often we wait for the right words of wisdom, the right tool, the right charismatic leader to come to fore and light an inspirational fire in us. For much of my career, I have waited for that leader or mentor who can spark the movement towards change that I can already see needs to happen. Those leaders, if they come, are fleeting sources of inspiration. True inspiration means facing things as they are and imagining what they can be. You look at your surroundings and see work that needs to be done, but you don’t quite know how to begin.  Someone speaks to you – literally and metaphorically – at the right place and the right time, and you act.
