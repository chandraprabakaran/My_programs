So, I’ve been thinking about how maybe I’ve been on the wrong track, that inspiration is not that rush of insightful adrenalin that comes upon us unexpectedly. It is not the feel good response we all have to stories of perseverance against hardship. It is not epiphany; it is not a call from the almighty, it is not the crazy mad electric charge of creativity or enlightenment that comes from sitting at the feet of the masters. Inspiration, truly, is the legacy of despair, dejection, and endless effort, the courageous pursuit of change in the face of obdurate opposition, and the result of stubborn, enduring hard work.
